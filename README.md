# Aloha project part 1

## The goal was to build a website similar to an image that was given.

### Link to my website : <https://shamu92.github.io/aloha-project/>


#### This project was done using HTML, CSS, and Java Script.

###### I made a webpage for Aloha Apparel using the things that we learned the first week of class.

### This is part two of project 1.

##### The websiste is fully optimized for three different screen sizes.

##### I added Jquery plug-ins to enable smooth scrolling and the gallery of products with a slider. An alert was added to the 

##### email submit form to make sure that the user inputs a valid email address.

##### I downloaded and added the images that were provided for this part of the project. 

###### I also took into acount the comments about part 1 of this project.

#### This website was tested across most major browsers.

##### I also tried to add the simpleCart plug in as a stretch goal. It doesn't work right now, but I believe it's very close.
